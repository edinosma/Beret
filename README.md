### Beret, a level editor and viewer for FEZ.
---

#### Usage:
1. Use [FEZRepacker](https://github.com/FEZModding/FEZRepacker) to extract the contents of your FEZ `.pak` files. Note that most of the good stuff is stored in `Other.pak`!
2. Launch Godot, and run MainScene.tscn.
3. Load the "root" folder (the folder where `Essentials` and `Other` are found).
